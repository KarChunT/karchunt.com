# Docker Compose

<Callout type="info">
  Use to startup multiple Docker containers at the same time.
</Callout>

## compose.yaml

- [Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)  
- [Examples](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master)

<Callout type="info">
  All configurations here are the same from the `docker run` command. Currently, I'm showing docker compose v2 instead of v1. So some syntax might be different due to some syntax already deprecated.
</Callout>

A default network is **created** for all the composed containers. that means all containers that are created will be **automatically added** to that network.

```yaml filename="compose.yaml"
name: apiapp
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    networks:
      - db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: sonar
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: sonar
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  sonarqube:
    image: sonarqube:lts
    ports:
      - '9000:9000'
      - '9092:9092'
    networks:
      - db
    environment:
      SONAR_JDBC_URL: jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/sonar
      SONAR_JDBC_USERNAME: sonar
      SONAR_JDBC_PASSWORD: sonarpasswd
    depends_on:
      - postgres
  apiapplication:
    build: ./
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - ./app:/app
    depends_on:
      - postgres
  server:
    build:
      context: ./server # system look dir to search for Dockerfile
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
networks:
  db:
volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Additional;

- If you want to specify `-it` in `compose.yaml`, you will have to specify these two fields (mandatory)
  - `stdin_open: true` - This service needs an open input connection
  - `tty: true` - Attaching this terminal
  - `-it` = `stdin_open` + `tty`
- If you want to override the `Dockerfile` entrypoint, you can specify `entrypoint` within `compose.yaml`, then it will override the entrypoint in `Dockerfile` that is defined.

## Commands

[Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/)

Use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`.

### List containers

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### Build or rebuild containers

It only builds containers **without starting** it.

```bash
docker compose build
```

### Create and start containers

**Up = Build/rebuild + start**

```bash
docekr compose up
docker compose up --build # rebuild containers (build images before starting containers)
docker compose -d up # running in backgound
docker compose -f <compose-file> up
docker compose up <service> <service> # start only a few service
```

### Execute a command in a running container

By default, it will allocate a **TTY** by default, so you can straight away get an **interactive prompt** from this command `docker compose exec apiservice bash`.

```bash
docker compose exec <service-name> <commands>
docker compose exec -it apiservice bash # old version
docker compose exec apiservice bash # new version
```

### Display service log output

```bash
docker compose logs
```

### Stop services

Stop running containers **without removing** them. The services can be started again with `docker compose start`.

```bash
docker compose stop
```

### Stop and remove containers, networks

```bash
docker compose down
```
