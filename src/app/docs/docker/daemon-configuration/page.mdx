# Daemon Configuration

## Docker Service Configuration

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker # start docker service
sudo systemctl status docker # check docker service status
sudo systemctl stop docker # stop docker service
```

## Start Docker Daemon manually

```bash
dockerd
dockerd --debug # useful for troubleshooting and debugging purposes
```

## Unix Socket

![unix socket](/docs/docker/unix-socket.gif)

Unit socket is an **IPC** (inter-process communication mechanism) that enables **communication** between **Docker clients** on the **same host**, such as CLI, SDK, and the Docker Daemon.

It will **listen on an internal Unix Socket** at the path `/var/run/docker.sock` when the Docker daemon starts. So when the container is built, the Docker socket file from the host machine will be **mounted** into the filesystem of the Docker container, so the Docker container can **access** to the Docker Daemon API via Docker CLI, as Docker CLI is configured to interact with the Docker Daemon on this socket.

<Callout type="warn">
  Making Docker Daemon accessible outside of the Docker host is not a good approach due to security reasons.
</Callout>

By default, the Docker Daemon can only accessible within the same host as it's only listening on the Unix Socket. Of course, Docker Daemon can also listen on a TCP interface on the Docker host.

```bash
dockerd --debug --host=tcp://192.168.0.196:2375
```

- `192.168.0.196` = IP address of the host/machine
- `2375` = standard port for Docker (unencrypted traffic)

Then, other hosts can trigger any Docker commands to this Docker host by targeting their Docker Daemon to the TCP interface.

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.0.196:2375"
export DOCKER_TLS=true # initiate secure connection
```

You can fix the TCP security issue (unencrypted traffic) by setting up TLS encryption to Docker Daemon.

```bash
dockerd --debug \
  --host="tcp://192.168.0.196:2376" \
  --tls=true \
  --tlscert="/var/docker/server.pem" \
  --tlskey=/var/docker/serverkey.pem
```

- When TLS is enabled, remember to change the port to 2376, as it's the standard port for encrypted traffic.

However, there is still **no authentication** for others. Therefore, they can do whatever they want with Docker Daemon straight away. So, we have to enable **certificate-based authentication**.

```bash
dockerd --debug \
  --host="tcp://192.168.0.196:2376" \
  --tls=true \
  --tlscert="/var/docker/server.pem" \
  --tlskey="/var/docker/serverkey.pem" \
  --tlsverify=true \
  --tlscacert="/var/docker/caserver.pem"
```

- `tlsverify` = enable authentication
- `tlscacert` = use to verify client certificates. Therefore, the client will only be able to access Docker Daemon when they have the respective certificate.

On the client side, we will have to generate certificates for them called `client.pem` and `clientkey.pem`. After that, they will have to `export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=true`.

Sometimes, it's hard for users to memorize and manually insert all those options and configurations. Therefore, those options and configurations can move to a file, `/etc/dockers/daemon.json`.

```json filename="/etc/dockers/daemon.json"
{
  "debug": true,
  "hosts": ["tcp://192.168.0.196:2376"],
  "tls": true,
  "tlscert": "/var/docker/server.pem",
  "tlskey": "/var/docker/serverkey.pem",
  "tlsverify": true,
  "tlscacert": "/var/docker/caserver.pem",
  "live-restore": true // the container will continue to run even Docker Daemon stops
}
```

If you continue to specify those options and configurations via `dockerd` command, it will display an error message.

Once you edit this file `/etc/dockers/daemon.json`, remember to reload Docker.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload docker
# see your docker info after configuration
docker system info
```

## Logging Driver

<Callout type="info">
  `docker logs` command is used to get container logs.
</Callout>

[Docker Logging Driver Configuration](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/)

Docker Daemon has a default logging driver, which is **json-file**. You can use `docker system info` to get the current logging driver. All the containers logs are stored under this file `/var/lib/docker/containers/<id>.json` by default.

```bash
cat <id>.json
```

Of course, there are multiple logging driver options that the user can change;

- json-file (default)
- none
- syslog
- local
- journald (docker logs)
- splunk
- awslogs

```json filename="/etc/docker/daemon.json"
{
  "log-driver": "awslogs",
  "log-opt": {
    // additional options for logging region
    "awslogs-region": "ap-southeast-1"
  }
}
```

With this setup, all the container logs will be sent to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

## Storage Driver

[Reference](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver/)

> Docker uses the storage drivers to **store image layers** and to store data in the **writable layer** of a container. The storage driver **controls** how **images** and **containers** are **stored** and **managed** on your Docker host.
>
> â€” docker.docs

Supported storage drivers;

- overlay2
- btrfs and zfs
- vfs
- fuse-overlayfs

Proceed to this `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file to change the storage driver.

```json filename="/etc/docker/daemon.json"
{
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
```

## Troubleshoot Docker Daemon

### View Docker Daemon Logs

```bash
journalctl -u docker.service
```

### Check free disk space on host

```bash
df -h
```
