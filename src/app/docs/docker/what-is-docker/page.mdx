Consider the case where you build a Python application that **contains a wide range of dependencies** (legacy and latest). This Python application needs to be shipped to the production environment on **different computers** with **different operating systems**. You have to ensure that every computer has the **same configurations** as your local. Traditionally, doing it manually takes time and sometimes you may run into issues with different operating systems.

With Docker, you can easily **manage your infrastructure** like you **manage your applications**, because it will package all the application source code as well as the tools, libraries, settings, runtime, and dependencies that your application needs into a container. So, you can deploy your Python application with the same configuration and settings into each computer.
