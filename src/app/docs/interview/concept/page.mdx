## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### What is OOP?

OOP uses **objects** to design software. An object will contain **attributes** (data, properties, variables) and **behaviors** (methods, functions). Basically, we will **define classes** that will **act as blueprints** for **creating objects**.

### Differences between Class and Object

| Class | Object |
|-------|--------|
| A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviours that the created objects will have. | An instance of a class. It contains data and methods defined by the class. |

### Four Principles/Pillars of OOP

| Pillar | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Encapsulation | **Bundle data** and **methods** into a **single class**. It **restricts direct access** to some of the **object's components**, which can **prevent the accidental modification of data**. Mainly **hiding internal state** and **implementation details**. |
| Inheritance | A mechanism to **create a new class (subclasses)** that **inherits attributes and methods** from an **existing class (parent classes)**. It allows for **code reuse** and establishes a **relationship** between classes. |
| Polymorphism | The ability to **use a single interface** to represent **different underlying data types**. It **allows methods to do different things** based on the **object** it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. Also, it allows **methods to have the same name** but **behave differently** based on the object type by using **method overriding** or **method overloading**. |
| Abstraction | **Hiding complex internal implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** of the object. It allows the developer to **focus on "what to do" (focus on what an object does)** rather than **"how to do it" (how it achieves its functionality)**. | 

### Method overriding vs Method overloading

| Concept | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Method Overriding | A **subclass** provides a **specific implementation** of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It **allows a subclass to modify** or **extend the behaviour** of the **inherited method**. |
| Method Overloading | The ability to **define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists** (different types or number of parameters) within the same class. It **allows a method to perform different tasks** based on the **arguments** passed to it. |
