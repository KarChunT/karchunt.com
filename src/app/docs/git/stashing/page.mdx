# Stashing

## Git Stash

Let's say that the Developer A is working on a third story on the **develop** branch. Suddenly, the Developer B says that there are some critical bugs that needs to be corrected immediately on the **main** branch.

Before the Developer A checkout to the **main** branch, it's necessary to place the changes made to the third story somewhere in order to have a clean working area if we want to solve the bugs on the **main** branch. As the story isn't finished yet, the Developer A don't want to commit it to his branch (develop).

In this case, we can use `git stash` command to stash all changes in the working area. We can keep on pushing the changes to the stash and the changes will simlpy pile up (treat like queue FIFO).

```bash
# Stash the changes
git stash
git stash push
git stash save "message"

# Apply the stash changes
git stash apply # re-applying the stashed changes without pop it
git stash pop
git stash pop stash@{1}
git stash branch branch-name stash@{1} # creating a branch from your stash, as you may run into conflicts when popping or applying your stash

# List all the stash
git stash list

# Show the differences between the current and a stash
git stash show
git stash show -p # view the full diff of a stash

# clear or drop stash
git stash clear # clear all the stashes
git stash drop stash@{1}
```
