# Forward CLI Arguments to a Command

You can **forward CLI arguments to a command** in Taskfile by using the `--` syntax. This allows you to pass additional arguments directly to the command being executed.

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yaml"
version: '3'
tasks:
  example:
    cmds:
      - npm {{.CLI_ARGS}}
```

```bash
task example -- install
```
