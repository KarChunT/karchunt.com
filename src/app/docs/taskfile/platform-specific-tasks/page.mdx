# Platform-Specific Tasks

<Callout title="Supported Platforms & Architectures">
  Refer here for the [list of supported platforms and architectures](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/internal/syslist/syslist.go)
</Callout>

You can **create platform-specific tasks in Taskfile to run commands based on the operating system**. This is useful when you need to **perform different actions on different platforms**, such as installing software or running scripts.

**If there is no OS match, the task will not run (no error will be thrown).**

## Restrict to Specific Platforms

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yml"
version: '3'

tasks:
  hello:windows:
    desc: Say hello from Windows
    platforms: [windows]
    cmds:
      - echo "Hello from Windows!"

  hello:linux:
    desc: Say hello from Linux and Darwin
    platforms: [linux, darwin]
    cmds:
      - echo "Hello from Linux and Darwin!"
```
**Remember multiple platforms are supported.**

## Restrict to Specific Architectures

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yml"
version: '3'

tasks:
  hello:amd64:
    desc: Say hello from amd64
    platforms: [amd64]
    cmds:
      - echo "Hello from amd64!"
```

## Restrict to Specific Platforms and/or Architectures

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yml"
version: '3'
tasks:
  hello:windows:amd64:
    desc: Say hello from Windows amd64
    platforms: [windows/amd64]
    cmds:
      - echo "Hello from Windows amd64!"
```

## Restrict to Specific Platforms and/or Architectures within an individual commands

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yml"
version: '3'
tasks:
  hello:
    cmds:
      - cmd: echo "Hello from Windows!"
        platforms: [windows]
      - cmd: echo "Hello from Windows!"
        platforms: [linux, amd64]
      - cmd: |-
          echo "Running on all platforms!"
          echo "This will run regardless of the platform."
```
