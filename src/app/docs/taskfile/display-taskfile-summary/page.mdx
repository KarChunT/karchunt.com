# Display Taskfile Summary

You can **display a summary of your Taskfile** using the `task` command with the `--summary` flag. This will provide you with an **overview of the tasks defined** in your Taskfile, including their **names**, **descriptions**, and any **dependencies**.

**If a summary is missing, the description will be displayed instead. If neither is available, a warning is printed.**
