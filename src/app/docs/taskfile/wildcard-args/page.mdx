# Wildcard Arguments

Normally you can [pass arguments to a command](/docs/taskfile/forward-cli-arguments-to-cmd) in Taskfile, but sometimes you may want to **pass multiple arguments at once**. In such cases, you can use wildcard arguments.

The **arguments are stored** in `.MATCH` variable.

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yaml"
version: '3'
tasks:
  service:*:*:
    vars:
      SERVICE_NAME: "{{index .MATCH 0}}"
      REPLICAS: "{{index .MATCH 1}}"
    cmds:
      - 'echo Service Name: {{.SERVICE_NAME}}'
      - 'echo Replicas: {{.REPLICAS}}'
  service:*:
    vars:
      SERVICE_NAME: "{{index .MATCH 0}}"
    cmds:
      - 'echo Service Name: {{.SERVICE_NAME}}'
```

```bash filename="Demo and Output"
ubuntu@touted-mite:~$ task service:nginx
task: [service:*] echo Service Name: nginx
Service Name: nginx

ubuntu@touted-mite:~$ task service:nginx:2
task: [service:*:*] echo Service Name: nginx
Service Name: nginx
task: [service:*:*] echo Replicas: 2
Replicas: 2
```

```bash
# You can alsop use whitespace in the arguments as long as you quote them
task "service:nginx hello-world"
```
