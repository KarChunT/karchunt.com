# Watch Tasks

<Callout>
  If you set `watch: true` to a task, it will **only run from the CLI** via `task <task-name>`, but if you **call it from another task either directly** or as a **dependency**, **it will not run in watch mode**. This is because the **watch mode is designed for interactive use**, **not for automated task execution**.
</Callout>

**Watch** tasks in Taskfile allow you to **automatically run tasks when files change**. This is particularly **useful for development workflows** where you want to rebuild or recompile your code whenever a file is modified. There are two ways to define watch tasks:
- `--watch` or `-w` flag in the command line
- `watch: true` field in the Taskfile

The **default watch interval is 100 milliseconds**, but you can **change the interval** by setting `interval: 200ms` in the **root of the Taskfile** or passing `--interval 200ms` flag in the command line.

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yaml"
version: '3'
interval: 200ms
tasks:
  dev:
    watch: true
    sources:
      - 'test.txt'
      - '**/*.py'
    cmds:
      - echo "File changed, running task..."
      - echo "Rebuilding project..."
```
