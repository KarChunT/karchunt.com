# Ignore Errors

You can use the `ignore_error: true` attribute in your Taskfile to **ignore errors** during task execution. This allows subsequent tasks to **continue running even if a previous task fails**.

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yaml"
version: '3'
tasks:
  lint:
    internal: true
    ignore_error: true
    cmds:
      - exit 1
  deploy:
    cmds:
      - task: lint
      - echo "This will run even if lint fails"
```

```bash filename="Demo and Output"
ubuntu@touted-mite:~$ task deploy 
task: [lint] exit 1
task: [deploy] echo "This will run even if lint fails"
This will run even if lint fails
```
