We know that tasks are run in the **current directory** where the Taskfile is located. However, you can actually **run the Taskfile tasks in another directory** by using the `dir` keyword.

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yml"
version: '3'
tasks:
  get-working-directory:
    dir: ./app1
    cmds:
      - pwd
```

**If the directory does not exist, Task will create it.**

```bash filename="Demo and output"
ubuntu@touted-mite:~$ task get-working-directory 
task: [get-working-directory] pwd
/home/ubuntu/app1
```
