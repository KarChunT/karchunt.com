# If Else Condition

You can use **if-else conditions** in Taskfile to **control the execution of tasks based on certain conditions**. This allows you to create more dynamic and flexible task definitions.

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yaml"
version: '3'
tasks:
  example:
    summary: |
      An example task that uses if-else conditions
    vars:
      CONDITION: true
    cmds:
      - echo "Starting task..."
      - |
        {{ if .CONDITION }}
          echo "Condition is true, executing this block"
        {{ else }}
          echo "Condition is false, executing this block"
        {{ end }}
      - echo "Task completed"
```

```bash filename="Demo and Output"
ubuntu@touted-mite:~$ task example 
task: [example] echo "Starting task..."
Starting task...
task: [example] 
  echo "Condition is true, executing this block"


Condition is true, executing this block
task: [example] echo "Task completed"
Task completed
```
