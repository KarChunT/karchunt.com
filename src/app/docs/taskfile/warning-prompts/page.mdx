# Warning Prompts

You can **prompt the user for confirmation** before running a task by using the `prompt` field in the Taskfile. This is useful for tasks that might have **significant consequences**, such as deleting files or making changes to a production environment.

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yaml"
version: '3'

tasks:
  example:
    cmds:
      - task: not-dangerous
      - task: dangerous
      - task: super-dangerous
      - task: another-not-dangerous

  not-dangerous:
    internal: true
    cmds:
      - echo 'not dangerous command'

  another-not-dangerous:
    internal: true
    cmds:
      - echo 'another not dangerous command'

  dangerous:
    internal: true
    prompt: This is a dangerous command... Do you want to continue?
    cmds:
      - echo 'dangerous command'

  super-dangerous:
    prompt:
      - This is a dangerous command... Do you want to continue?
      - Please confirm your action.
    cmds:
      - echo 'super dangerous command'
```
- the `prompt` field can be a **list** as well.
