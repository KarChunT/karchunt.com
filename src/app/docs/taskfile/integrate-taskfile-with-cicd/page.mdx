# Integrate Taskfile with CI/CD

When you want to integrate Taskfile with your CI/CD pipeline, there are multiple ways that you can **reference the remote Taskfile**.
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>/Taskfile.yml`
- `https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git//<path>/Taskfile.yml?ref=main`
  - `//<path>` make sure to include the `//` before the path.
- `git@github.com/<username>/<repo>.git//<path>/Taskfile.yml?ref=main`

<Steps>

### Enable this remote experiment feature

```bash
# Set the environment variable to download the remote taskfile
export TASK_X_REMOTE_TASKFILES=1 
```

### Include remote Taskfile or execute from CLI directly

```bash
task --taskfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-task/task/main/website/static/Taskfile.yml
```

**OR**

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yml"
version: '3'

includes:
  # without authentication
  app-remote: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-task/task/main/website/static/Taskfile.yml
  # with authentication
  app-remote-auth: https://{{.TOKEN}}@raw.githubusercontent.com/go-task/task/main/website/static/Taskfile.yml
```

```bash
task app-remote

export TOKEN=<your-token>
task app-remote-auth
```

### [Optional]: Force download the remote Taskfile**

By default, the cache will be stored in the `.task` directory. But if you want to make sure the remote Taskfile always up-to-date, you can force download it by using the `--download` flag or you can use `--clear-cache` to clear all remote cache.

```bash
# Choose one of the following commands that suits your needs
task --download -y # force download the remote Taskfile
task --clear-cache # clear all remote cache
```

</Steps>
