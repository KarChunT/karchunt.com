# Interactive CLI Application

In some cases, your application **may need to interact with the user**. So, we can use `interactive: true` to **enable an interactive CLI application**. This allows you to prompt the user for input and handle it accordingly.

```yaml filename="Taskfile.yaml"
version: '3'

tasks:
  default:
    cmds:
      - vim my-file.txt
    interactive: true
```
