# Readiness Probes

## Pod setup process, status, and conditions

Before we straight away understand how to use **Readiness Probes**. Let's understand the **Pod** setup process, status, and conditions.

1. The scheduler will **determine** which node to place the pod.
2. Once the pod is scheduled on the right node, it will **pull** the images, **convert** it into a container, and the container will **start** after done pulling the image.
3. Then, the pod will go into a **running state** by making sure all the **containers are ready (ready conditions)**.

```mermaid

  status[Pod Scheduled] --> status2
  status2[Pull, convert, and start the container] --> status3
  status3[Containers are ready] --> status4
  status4[Running status or ready condition]
```

The **ready condition** actually **indicates** that the application running inside the pod is **now ready to accept the user traffic**, because by default, Kubernetes assumes when the container is created, it is ready to accept the user traffic, therefore it will set the **ready condition** to **true** for all the containers.

## Usage of Readiness Probes

[Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-readiness-probes)

The concept of Readiness probes basically is to **determine whether a container is ready to accept the traffic** by **performing some health checks**. If the readiness probes are successful, then we know that container is going to run and accept the traffic, else, it (kubelet) will remove the pod and try again.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Container] --> B{Check container is ready to accept the traffic?}
  B -->|Yes| C[Healthy]
  B -->|No| D[Unhealthy]
  D --> E[Remove the pod]
  E --> B
```

Examples of Readiness Probes usage;
- **Test** the web application is **online**
- **Check** whether the Database TCP connection is **online** or **ready**
- **Run** the **exec command** to run a custom script that will determine the application is **ready**

**HTTP**
```yaml filename="readiness-probes.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web-app
      image: webapp
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /api/v1/health
          port: 8000
        initialDelaySeconds: 5 # Number of seconds after the container has started before startup, that means it should wait for 5 seconds before performing the 1st probe
        periodSeconds: 3 # how often to perform the probe
        failureThreshold: 5 # default 3, if the application is not ready after 3 attempts, then the probe will stop
```

**TCP**
```yaml filename="readiness-probes.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web-app
      image: webapp
      readinessProbe:
        tcpSocket:
          port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 5 # Number of seconds after the container has started before startup, that means it should wait for 5 seconds before performing the 1st probe
        periodSeconds: 3 # how often to perform the probe
        failureThreshold: 5 # default 3, if the application is not ready after 3 attempts, then the probe will stop
```

**kubelet** will try to **open a socket** to the container on the specified port `8080`. If it can **establish the connection**, then the state is **healthy**.

---
**exec**
```yaml filename="readiness-probes.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web-app
      image: webapp
      readinessProbe:
        exec:
          command:
            - cat
            - /app/healthy
        initialDelaySeconds: 5 # Number of seconds after the container has started before startup, that means it should wait for 5 seconds before performing the 1st probe
        periodSeconds: 3 # how often to perform the probe
        failureThreshold: 5 # default 3, if the application is not ready after 3 attempts, then the probe will stop
```

It will **return 0 status code** if the **command succeed**.
