</Callout>

When you want to **pull an image** from a **private registry**, you need to **provide the credentials** to **authenticate** with the **registry**. Therefore, you need to **create a secret** that contains the credentials and then use that secret to pull the image.

<Steps>
### Create registry secret

You can use either one to create registry secret:
- [Imperative way to create registry secret](/docs/kubernetes/env-and-secrets-setup#imperative-1)
- [Declarative way to create registry secret](/docs/kubernetes/env-and-secrets-setup#docker-config)

### Apply secret to pod

```yaml filename="pod.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: my-secret # secret name
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image
```

</Steps>
