The **Center for Internet Security (CIS)** provides **benchmarks** for Kubernetes, etc. These benchmarks are a set of best practices for securing Kubernetes clusters. The benchmarks are available for free and can be [downloaded](https://learn.cisecurity.org/benchmarks#:~:text=The%20CIS%20Benchmarks%20are%20distributed,%2Doriginated%2C%20de%20facto%20standards.) from the CIS website.

They also provide a tool called **CIS-CAT** that can be used to **assess the security** of your Kubernetes cluster against the benchmarks. It will **generate a report (HTML)** that will show you the areas where your cluster **is not compliant** with the benchmarks.
