# Manual Scheduling

There are different ways to manual schedule a pod on a node. Now for some cases, you don't want to rely on the **Kubernetes built-in scheduler** or you **don't have a scheduler** in your cluster, or you want to **schedule the pod by yourself**. How would you do that?

So we know that the scheduling works like this
1. **What to schedule?** -> Pod
2. **Which node to schedule?**
3. **Schedule/Bind Pod to Node**

Here is an example of Pod definition YAML file.

```yaml filename="sample.yaml" {9}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu
      image: ubuntu
  nodeName: node01
```

Every pod has a **field** called `nodeName` and by **default is not set**. Normally you won't set this field, as this field will **auto being added by Kubernetes**. Here are the steps of how Kubernetes will auto add this field.
1. First, the **Scheduler** will go through all the pods and **check which pods do not** have this **property set**: `nodeName`.
2. The **Scheduler** will **run the scheduling algorithm** to **determine** and **identify** the **right node** for the pod.
3. Lastly, the **scheduler** will **schedule the pod on the node** by setting this property set: `nodeName` to the **name of the node** by **creating a binding object**.

---
If you **don't have a scheduler** in your cluster, then when you deployed the pods, those **pods status** will be in **Pending** state, as **nobody monitor and schedule nodes** for those deployed pods.

In this case, you can **manually assign** those pods to the specified node by yourself **without a scheduler** (set the `nodeName` field to the node name). Note that, you can only specify the `nodeName` at the **Pod creation time**.

```yaml filename="sample.yaml" {9}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu
      image: ubuntu
  nodeName: node01
```

---
Here is the another scenario, assume your **pod already created** and you would like to **assign the deployed pod to a node**. Now, we know that once you deployed the Pod, Kubernetes **don't allow you to modify** the `nodeName` property field. How would you do that?

Well, in this case, we can create a **Binding object** and send a **POST** request to the **Pod's binding API**, with this method, we can assign a node to the existing deployed pod.

```yaml filename="binding.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Binding
metadata:
  name: sample-binding
target:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Node
  name: node03
```

Remember, you must **convert the above YAML file to JSON format** for **POST** request.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"apiVersion": "v1","kind": "Binding","metadata": {"name": "sample-binding"},"target": {"apiVersion": "v1","kind": "Node","name": "node03"}}' \

```
