# Job

## Concept and Usage of Job

Job will **create one or more pods**. The job will be **considered as completed** when all the pods inside the job are **completed**. When you delete a job, the pods created by the job will be deleted too.

Use case;
- Running a batch Job
- Backup operation

```yaml filename="job.yaml"
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: backup-job
spec:
  completions: 3 # run 3 pods
  parallelism: 2 # parallel run 2 pods at a time
  template: # pod template
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: backup
          image: busybox
          command: ["echo", "Backup operation"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

If some of the pods fail, the job **will create new pods to replace the failed ones** until the **specified number of completions (3)** is **achieved**. The job will **keep retrying** until all Pods have successfully completed or the job is deleted. However, since the `restartPolicy` is set to `Never`, the pod **will not be restarted** if it fails, instead, **new Pod** will be **created** to **replace them**.

```bash
kubectl get jobs
kubectl delete job <job-name>
```
