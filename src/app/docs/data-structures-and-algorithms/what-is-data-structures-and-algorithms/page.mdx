# What is Data Structures and Algorithms?

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that are essential for **efficient data management** and **problem-solving**.

## Data Structures

Data structures are used to **organize, store, and manage data** in memory efficiently. Basically it defines the way data operations are performed on the data like **insertion**, **deletion**, **searching**, and **updating**.

For example, some common data structures include:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Heaps

Each data structure has its **own strengths** and **weaknesses**, and the choice of which one to use **depends on the specific requirements of the application** as it will **affect the performance** of **data operations**.

## Algorithms

Algorithms are **step-by-step procedure** or **instructions** to **solve specific problems** or perform a particular task. Algorithms take input data, process it according to a defined set of instructions, and produce output.

  The efficiency of an algorithm is often measured in terms of **time complexity** (how long it takes to run) and **space complexity** (how much memory it uses).

Some common types of algorithms include:
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem)
