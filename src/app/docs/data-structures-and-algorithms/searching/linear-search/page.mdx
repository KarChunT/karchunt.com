# Linear Search

## What is Linear Search?

Linear search known as **sequential search**. It is a **simple searching algorithm** that **checks every element in a list or array one by one** until it **finds the target value** or **reaches the end** of the list.

<Callout type="important" title="Time & Space Complexity">
  Best Case: **O(1)** - The target element is found at the **first position**.  
  Worst Case: **O(n)** - The target element is at the **last position** or not present at all.  
  Average Case: **O(n)** - On average, half of the elements need to be checked.

  For space complexity, Linear Search uses **O(1)** space since it only requires a **constant amount of additional memory** for variables, regardless of the input size.
</Callout>

Of course, Linear Search is **not the most efficient for large datasets**, but it **does not require the data to be sorted** and is easy to implement.

<Callout title="Suitable Use Cases">
  - Small datasets where simplicity is preferred over efficiency
  - Unsorted data
</Callout>

### How it works?

  subgraph array["Array: [4, 2, 7, 1, 3]"]
    A0["0: 4"]
    A1["1: 2"]
    A2["2: 7"]
    A3["3: 1<br>(target)"]
    A4["4: 3"]
  end

  P[Pointer] --> A0
  A0 --> A1 --> A2 --> A3 --> A4

Assuming we have an array `[4, 2, 7, 1, 3]` and we are searching for the target value `1`:
- We start at the **first element** (4) and **compare** it to the target (1). Since they are not equal, we move to the next element.
- We **compare** the second element (2) to the target (1). Again, they are not equal, so we move on.
- We **compare** the third element (7) to the target (1). Still not equal, so we continue.
- We **compare** the fourth element (1) to the target (1). This time, they are equal, so we have **found the target** at index `3`.

## Implementation

```python filename="linear_search.py"
def linear_search(arr: list, target: int) -> int:
    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value == target:
            return index
    return -1

data = [4, 2, 7, 1, 3]
search_target = 1

result = linear_search(data, search_target)
if result != -1:
    print(f"Element {search_target} found at index {result}.")
else:
    print(f"Element {search_target} not found in the array.")
```
