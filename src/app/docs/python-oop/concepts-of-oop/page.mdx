# Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

<Callout type="warn" title="Important">
  This section will include all the topics related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. I will cover the following topics in each section.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP**) is a programming paradigm that uses **"objects"** to design software. An **object** will **contain attributes (data, properties, variables)** and **behaviors (methods, functions)**. You will **start by defining classes** which will **act as blueprints** for **creating objects**.
- **Attributes**: **Variables** associated with the object that **hold data**. For example, a `Car` object might have attributes like `color`, `model`, and `year`.
- **Methods**: **Functions** associated with the object that **define its behavior/action**. For example, a `Car` object might have methods like `start()`, `stop()`, and `accelerate()`.


### Classes and Objects

| Type | Explanation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Class | A **blueprint for creating objects**. It defines the **attributes and behaviours** that the created objects will have. |
| Object | An **instance of a class**. It **contains data and methods** defined by the class. |

### Four Pillars of OOP

| Pillar | Explanation |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Encapsulation | **Bundle data (attributes)** and **methods (behaviours)** into a **single unit (class)**. It **restricts direct access** to some of the **object's components**, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. Mainly **hiding internal state** and **implementation details**. |
| Inheritance | A mechanism to **create a new class (subclasses)** that **inherits attributes and methods** from an **existing class (parent classes)**. It allows for **code reuse** and establishes a **relationship** between classes. |
| Polymorphism | The ability to **use a single interface** to represent **different underlying data types**. It **allows methods to do different things** based on the **object** it is acting upon. Also, it allows **methods to have the same name** but **behave differently** based on the object type by using **method overriding** or **method overloading**.
| Abstraction | **Hiding complex internal implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** of the object. It allows the developer to **focus on "what to do" (focus on what an object does)** rather than **"how to do it" (how it achieves its functionality)**. |

### Benefits of OOP

I just highlight some of the key benefits of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) below. There are many more benefits, but these are the most important ones that you should know.

| Benefit | Explanation |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Code Reusability | OOP allows for **reusing existing code** through inheritance, which reduces redundancy and improves maintainability. |
| Modularity | **Breaks down complex systems** into **smaller manageable pieces** (classes and objects), making it easier to understand, develop, modify, maintain, and debug code. |
| Flexibility and Scalability | OOP allows for **easier modifications** and **extensions** to existing code. New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code, making it easier to scale applications. |
| Clear structure and enhanced collaboration | OOP promotes a **clear structure** for organizing xode, which makes it easier for teams to work together. |
