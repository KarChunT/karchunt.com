# Remote Tunneling

## Remote tunneling to a server

<Callout type="info">
  The concept is same as local tunneling.
</Callout>

A remote tunnel makes a connection to a remote server. The remote port must be specified when creating the remote tunnel. As a result, the remote computer able to connect or access your localhost. To establish a remote tunnel to your remote server, use `-R` parameter when connecting and must provide

- Remote port for accessing the tunneled connection
- Local host IP/name
- Local host port

For general usage, connect to `localhost` on port 8080 on our local computer, then your remote machine is able to ping or make the connetion to the localhost through port 8080.

```bash
ssh -f -N -R <remote-port>:<local-host-ip-address/name>:<local-port> <username>@<remote-host-ip-address/name/gateway>
# example
ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 user@remote-host-ip-address/gateway
```

Now if you go to your **remote** browser/curl to `localhost:8080`, you are able to see the content that hosted at `localhost:80`.

| Parameters | Description                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| -R         | establish a remote tunnel to your remote server |

### Remote tunneling local network

You can tunnel your local network to remote host. Here is the animation diagram of the local network web server and common SSH server.

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 user@remote-host-ip-address/gateway
ssh -R 0.0.0.0:8080:localhost:8080 user@remote-host-ip-address/gateway
```

### Remote tunneling private network

You can tunnel your local private network to remote host. Here is the animation diagram of the private network web server and common SSH server.

```bash
ssh -R 8080:<local-server-ip-address>:8080 user@remote-host-ip-address/gateway
ssh -R 0.0.0.0:8080:<local-server-ip-address>:8080 user@remote-host-ip-address/gateway
```
