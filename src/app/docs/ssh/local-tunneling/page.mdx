## Local tunneling to a server

Traffic between the localhost and remote host can be **tunneled** via SSH connections. To establish a local tunnel on your remote server, use `-L` parameter when connecting and must provide

- Local port for accessing the tunneled connection
- Remote host IP/name
- Remote host port

For general usage, connect to `10.0.0.12` on port 80 on your remote host, then your local machine is able to ping or make the connection to the remote host through port 8080.

```bash
ssh -f -N -L <local-port>:<remote-host-ip-address/name>:<remote-port> <username>@<host>
# example
ssh -L 8080:10.0.0.12:80 username@host
```

Now if you go to your browser/curl to `localhost:8080`, you are able to see the content that hosted at `10.0.0.12:80`.

| Parameters | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -f         | let SSH go into the background before executing               |
| -N         | does not open a shell or execute a program on the remote side |
| -L         | establish a local tunnel to your remote server                |

If you want to terminate the background connection, you have to find the PID and kill it.

```bash
ps aux | grep <local-port>
kill <process-id>
```

```bash
Output

```

```bash
kill 5965
```

### Local tunneling local network

You can tunnel remote host local network to your local. Here is the animation diagram of the local network web server and common SSH server.

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@server
```

### Local tunneling private network

You can tunnnel remote host private network to your local. Here is the animation diagram of the private network web server and common SSH server.

```bash
ssh -L <local-port>:<server-ip-address>:<server-port> <username>@<bastion-server-ip-address>
ssh -L 8080:10.0.0.12:8080 user@bastion
```
