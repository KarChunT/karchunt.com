# Host Configuration

## Host Specific Configuration file

Create a config filename `config` in your local `~/.ssh` directory.

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

You can define each individual SSH configuration options into this file. You can find all the SSH configuration options from this [ssh_config](https://man.cx/ssh_config).
