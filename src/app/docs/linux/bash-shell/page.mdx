# Bash Shell

The **Bash shell (Bourne Again SHell)** is a widely used command-line interpreter for Unix-like operating systems. It provides a powerful interface for users to interact with the system, execute commands, and run scripts.

## Identify the Bash Shell

<Callout title="Note">
  The `/bin/bash` is very popular as it **offers a rich set of features**, including command history, tab completion, and scripting capabilities.
</Callout>

To check which shell you're currently using, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
```

You can also use the `env` command to see the current shell:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ env | grep SHELL
SHELL=/bin/bash
```

## Changing the Default Shell

If you want to change your default shell to Bash, you can use the `chsh` (change shell) command. Here's how to do it:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ chsh
Password:
Changing the login shell for karchunt
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Login Shell [/bin/bash]: /bin/sh
```

or

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ chsh -s /bin/bash
Password:
```

After running the command, you will need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

## Bash Features

### Command Auto-completion

Bash supports command auto-completion, which allows you to quickly complete commands and file names by pressing the `Tab` key. For example:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ ls folder
folder1/ folder3/
```

Pressing `Tab` after typing `folder` will auto-complete the command to `folder1/` or `folder3/` if there is no ambiguity.

### Command history

Bash maintains a history of commands you've executed, which you can access using the `history` command or by pressing the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys. This feature allows you to easily recall and re-execute previous commands.

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ history
  1  ls
  2  cd folder1
  3  nano file.txt
  4  history
```

### Aliases 

Bash allows you to create aliases for frequently used commands, making it easier to execute them. You can define an alias using the `alias` command:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ alias ll='ls -la'
karchunt@kcserver:~$ ll
```

If you want to see all defined aliases, simply type `alias` without any arguments:

```bash
karchunt@DESKTOP-CCAQ09F:~$ alias
alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\'')"'
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ll='ls -la'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

To make it permanent, you can add the alias definition to your `~/.bashrc` file.

## Customizing Bash Prompt

Normally, when you login to a Bash shell, you will see `~$` as your prompt. You can customize the prompt by modifying the `PS1` variable in your `~/.bashrc` file. You can check the current setting of `PS1` by running:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ echo $PS1
\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$
```

Here are some common escape sequences you can use to customize your prompt:
- `\u`: Username
- `\h`: Hostname
- `\w`: Current working directory
- `\d`: Date
- `\t`: Current time

To change your prompt, you can edit the `PS1` variable in your `~/.bashrc` file or set it directly in the terminal:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ PS1="\d \u@\h:\w\$"
Thu Jan 29 karchunt@kcserver:~$
```
