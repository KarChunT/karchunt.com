# Help Command

When you **need assistance** with Linux commands, there are several built-in help options available that will provide you a **quick reference** or **detailed information** about command usage.

## Using the `whatis` Command

The `whatis` command provides a brief description of a command. To use it, simply type `whatis` followed by the command name. For example:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ whatis ls
ls (1)               - list directory contents
```

## Using the `man` Command

The `man` command displays the manual pages for a command, providing detailed information about its usage, options, and examples. To access the manual for a command, type `man` followed by the command name. For example:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ man ls
LS(1)                                                                                                            User Commands                                                                                                           LS(1)       

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .
...
```

## Using the `--help` Option

Most Linux commands support the `--help` option, which provides a summary of the command's usage and available options. To use it, type the command followed by `--help` or `-h`. For example:

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~$ ls --help
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
  -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      --block-size=SIZE      with -l, scale sizes by SIZE when printing them;
                             e.g., '--block-size=M'; see SIZE format below
...
```

## Searching with `apropos`

The `apropos` command searches the manual page names and descriptions for a specified keyword. This is useful when you are unsure of the exact command name. For example:

```bash /copy/
karchunt@kcserver:~$ apropos copy
cp (1)               - copy files and directories
cpgr (8)             - copy with locking the given file to the password or group file

dd (1)               - convert and copy a file
debconf-copydb (1)   - copy a debconf database
git-checkout-index (1) - Copy files from the index to the working tree
install (1)          - copy files and set attributes
objcopy (1)          - copy and translate object files
rsync (1)            - a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
scp (1)              - OpenSSH secure file copy
ssh-copy-id (1)      - use locally available keys to authorise logins on a remote machine
