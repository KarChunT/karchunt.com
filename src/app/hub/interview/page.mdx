## Technical interviews

### Sorting

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and sorts them in ascending order.

```python filename="sort.py"
numbers = [50, 10, 20, 40, 30]

def bubble_sort(arr: list) -> list:
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```
