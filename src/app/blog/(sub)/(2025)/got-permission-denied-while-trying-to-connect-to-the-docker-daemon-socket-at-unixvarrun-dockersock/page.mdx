## Fix Docker permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`

<Callout>
  You might encounter this issue when you **close and reopen your terminal session** after adding your user to the `docker` group.
</Callout>

The error message "permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` typically occurs when the current user **does not have the necessary permissions** to access the Docker daemon.

To resolve this issue, you can **add your user** to the `docker` group, which grants the necessary permissions to interact with the Docker daemon without requiring `sudo` for every command.

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo reboot # It may be necessary to reboot your system for the changes to take effect.

docker ps # test connection
```

There is an alternative solution if you need to work now, without rebooting your system. I do **not recommend** this approach as a permanent solution, but it can be used as a temporary workaround.

```bash
newgrp docker
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

docker ps # test connection
```
