## Prevent every time push need password to git on Ubuntu

When working with Git on Ubuntu, sometimes you may find yourself needing to **enter password** or **access token** every time you push changes to a remote repository. This can be **inconvenient** and **time-consuming**. So, today I will show you how to configure Git to avoid this issue. There are several methods to achieve this, and I will cover the most common ones below.
- Using **SSH Keys (Recommended)**
- Using **Git Credential Helper**

### Method 1: Using SSH Keys (Recommended)

This method is the **most secure** and **recommended** way to do it, as it **generates a pair of cryptographic keys** for authentication on your local machine and **adding the public key** to your Git hosting service (like GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

1. **Generate SSH Key Pair**

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your_email@example.com>"
    ```

2. **Add SSH key to SSH agent and add private key**

    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

3. **Add the public key to your Git hosting service**

    Copy the content of your public key file and add it to your Git hosting service.

    ```bash filename="~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

    For my case is GitHub, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

4. **Change your remote URL to use SSH**

    ```bash
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git
    ```

### Method 2: Using Git Credential Helper

This method allows Git to **store your credentials** securely on your local machine, but it is **less secure than using SSH keys**. A credential helper will help you **cache your credentials** for a **certain period** or **store them permanently** depending on your configuration.

```bash
# For temporary caching (default is 15 minutes)
git config --global credential.helper cache

# Set cache timeout to 1 hour
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

# For storing credentials permanently (less secure)
git config --global credential.helper store
```

You can also use the [Git Credential Manager (GCM)](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager) for a more secure way to manager your credentials.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i <path-to-package>
git-credential-manager configure
```
