## Setup RDP on Ubuntu

To setup Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on Ubuntu, you can either use the built-in Remote Desktop sharing feature or install a third-party RDP server like `xrdp`.

### Method 1: Using Built-in Remote Desktop Sharing

This method only **allows one active session** at a time, meaning if someone is logged in locally, a remote user cannot connect until the local user logs out, even is different user accounts are used.

  My Ubuntu version is **24.04 LTS**. So the UI might differ slightly on other versions.
</Callout>

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **System** > **Remote Desktop**.
3. Toggle the switch to enable **Remote Desktop**.
4. Configure the settings as needed (e.g., username, password).

5. Enable **Remote Login** and setup login details if you want to allow remote connections.

6. If you have configured a firewall, ensure that port **3389** is open for RDP connections.

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
    ```

### Method 2: Installing xrdp

This method **allows multiple users to connect simultaneously** as it **creates separate remote sessions** that do not interfere with the local session. Assuming you have multiple user accounts set up on your Ubuntu machine, each user can log in remotely without disrupting others. That means each user will have their own isolated desktop environment.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp
sudo systemctl start xrdp

# Allow RDP through the firewall
sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
```
