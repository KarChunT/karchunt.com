## Check Ubuntu Static IP Configuration

To check the static IP configuration on Ubuntu, you can use the command line or the graphical user interface (GUI).

### Using `ip addr` command

When you run the following command, it will display all network interfaces and their IP addresses:

```bash
ip addr show
```

Look for the interface you are interested in (e.g., `etho`, `w1an0`) and check the `inet` line for the assigned IP address. Here is an example output:

```bash {4}
3: wlo1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether a0:29:42:00:3c:78 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname wlp0s20f3
    inet 192.168.0.20/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlo1
       valid_lft 84015sec preferred_lft 84015sec
    inet6 2001:e68:545b:1e09:a2b3:4edc:3df5:2478/64 scope global temporary dynamic 
       valid_lft 192901sec preferred_lft 84878sec
    inet6 2001:e68:545b:1e09:20ce:6713:d2e1:733a/64 scope global dynamic mngtmpaddr noprefixroute 
       valid_lft 192901sec preferred_lft 106501sec
    inet6 fe80::c7b2:63f6:791c:7ef9/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

- **Static IP**: If the line starting with `inet` (your IP address) **does not contain** the word `dynamic`, it indicates that the **IP address is statically assigned**.
- **DHCP (Dynamic)**: If you see `dynamic`, it means the **IP was assigned via DHCP**.

### Using `ip route` command

You can also check the routing table to see the default gateway and associated interface:

```bash
kc@kchomelab:~$ ip route list default
default via 192.168.0.1 dev wlo1 proto dhcp src 192.168.0.20 metric 600
```

- If the output includes `proto dhcp`, it indicates that the **IP address was assigned via DHCP**.
- If the output includes `proto static`, it indicates a **static IP configuration**.

### Inspect Netplan Configuration

You can check the Netplan configuration files located in `/etc/netplan/` to see if a static IP is configured. Use the following command to view the configuration:

```bash
grep -E "addresses:|dhcp4: (no|false)" /etc/netplan/*.yaml
```

If you see `addresses:` with a specific IP address and `dhcp4: no` or `dhcp4: false`, it indicates a **static IP configuration**.

### Using NetworkManager CLI

You can use the `nmcli` command to check the connection settings:

```bash
nmcli con show --active
```

Check the IPv4 method for a specific connection:

```bash
nmcli -f ipv4.method con show "<Your connection name>"
```

Here is an example:

```bash
kc@kchomelab:~$ nmcli -f ipv4.method con show "kc_5G"
ipv4.method:                            auto
```

- If the `ipv4.method` is set to `manual`, it indicates a **static IP configuration**.
- If it is set to `auto`, it indicates a **DHCP configuration**.

### GUI settings

You can also check the static IP configuration using the Ubuntu GUI:

1. Open the "**Settings**" application > "**Network or Wi-Fi**".
2. Click the **gear icon (Network options)** next to your network connection.
3. Go to the "**IPv4**" tab.
4. Check if the "**Method**" is set to "**Manual**" (indicating a static IP) or "**Automatic (DHCP)**" (indicating a dynamic IP).
