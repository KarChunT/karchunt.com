## Install Chinese Characters on Ubuntu

As far as I know, Ubuntu does not come with Chinese language support pre-installed. To install Chinese language support on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ibus-pinyin ibus-sunpinyin
```

<Callout title="Additional">
  Navigate to the "Input Method" tab and click "Add". Select "Chinese" and then choose your desired input method (e.g., "Chinese - Pinyin").
</Callout>

Then:

1. Open **"Settings"** > **"Region & Language"**.
2. Click **"Manage Installed Languages"**.
    - Ensure that **"Keyboard input method system"** is set to ibus.
3. Go to **"Install/Remove Languages"** and check the box next to **"Chinese (Simplified)"** or **"Chinese (Traditional)"** as needed.
4. Click **Apply**.
5. Under **"Input Sources"**, click the + button.
6. Select **"Chinese (China)"** and then choose your desired input method (e.g., **"Chinese (Intelligent Pinyin)"**).
7. Click **Add**.
8. Remember to **log out** and log back in for the changes to take effect.
