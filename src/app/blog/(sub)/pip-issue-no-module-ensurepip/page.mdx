## Pip issue: No module named 'ensurepip'

When you create a **virtual environment**, you might encounter the following error:

```text
Error: Command '['/home/kc/Desktop/projects/pretty/venv/bin/python3.11', '-m', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
```

The error indicates that the `ensurepip` module failed to set up `pip` in your virtual environment. This can happen if the **Python installation is incomplete or corrupted**, or if the **virtual environment was not created properly**.

Assuming you are using **Python 3.11** on a **Linux** system, here are the steps to resolve this issue:

<Steps>

### Ensure Python is Properly Installed

```bash
python3.11 --version
python3.11 -m ensurepip --version
```

### If the above commands fail, reinstall Python 3.11

For your information, many Linux distributions disable the bundled `ensurepip` module to force use of system packaging. To fix this, you can reinstall Python along with the `venv` and `dev` packages.

<Callout type="important">
  If your system package name differs (eg, `python3.11-venv`), adjust accordingly.
</Callout>

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --reinstall python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev
```

### Recreate the virtual environment

Now, delete the existing virtual environment and create a new one.

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
```
</Steps>
