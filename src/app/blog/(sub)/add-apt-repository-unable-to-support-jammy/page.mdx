## Add apt repository unable to support jammy

The error **"unable to support jammy"** typically occurs when trying to add an APT repository that **does not have packages available** for the **Ubuntu Jammy (22.04)** release. This can happen if the repository maintainer **has not yet provided support** for this version of Ubuntu.

To work around this issue, we can copy the `apt_pkg` shared object file from the existing Python installation to a more generic name that APT can recognize.

```bash
# You may need to adjust the Python version (e.g., cpython-310) based on your system
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
sudo cp apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so
```
