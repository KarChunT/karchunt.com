</Callout>

Before you begin, you need to have `docker` installed on your Ubuntu system, as Nektos Act relies on **Docker** to run GitHub Actions locally.  
You may refer this [guide](/docs/docker/docker-installation/) to install Docker on Ubuntu.

To install Nektos Act on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/download/v0.2.76/act_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvf act_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin act

act --version
```
