## Stop Service in Windows

To stop a service in Windows, you can use either the **Services management console** or the **Command Prompt**. Below are the steps for both methods.

In this guide, we will specifically look at stopping the `multipassd` service and preventing it from automatically restarting. Normally, services are set to restart automatically upon failure, but you can change this behavior.

  To **permanently disable** the service, use this command:  
  `sc config "[ServiceName]" start= disabled`
</Callout>

### Method 1: Using the Services Management Console (GUI)

1. Press `Windows Key + R`, type `services.msc`, and press `Enter`.
2. Scroll down and find the service named "Multipass Service" (or multipassd).
3. Right-click on the service and select Properties.
4. Go to the **"Recovery"** tab.
5. Change the actions for the **"First failure"**, **"Second failure"**, and **"Subsequent failures"** dropdowns to **"Take No Action"**.
6. Click **Apply** and then **OK**.
7. Restart your computer for the changes to take full effect, or manually stop the service using `sc stop "Multipass Service"` in an administrator Command Prompt.

### Method 2: Using Command Prompt (Administrator)

1. Open Command Prompt as an administrator (search for cmd, right-click, and select "Run as administrator").
2. Stop the currently running multipassd service:

    ```powershell
    sc stop "Multipass Service"
    ```
3. Configure the service to "Take No Action" on **subsequent failures** (this sets all three failure actions):

    <Callout type="success">
      Use reset= 0 (with a space).
    </Callout>

    ```powershell
    sc failure "Multipass Service" reset= 0 actions=
    ```
    - `reset= 0`: Resets the failure count after 0 seconds.
    - `actions=`: Specifies no action to take on failures.

    The changes should now be in effect the next time the service is started (either manually or after a system reboot).

4. Stop the service if it is still running:

    ```powershell
    sc stop "Multipass Service"
    ```
