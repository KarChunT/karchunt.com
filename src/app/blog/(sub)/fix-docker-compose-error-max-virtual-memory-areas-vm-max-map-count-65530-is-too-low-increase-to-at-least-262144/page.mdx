## Fix Docker Compose error - max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count 65530 is too low, increase to at least 262144

When using Docker Compose, you might encounter the following error:

```text
max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count 65530 is too low, increase to at least 262144
```

This error indicates that the current setting for `vm.max_map_count` is too low for the application you are trying to run inside a Docker container. This setting controls the maximum number of memory map areas a process may have. Increase VM max map count to the respective value

```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```
