## What is Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)?

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows developers to **run a Linux environment directly on Windows**, **without the overhead** of a **traditional virtual machine** or **dual-boot setup**.

There are two versions of WSL:
- **WSL 1**: An compatibility layer for translating Linux system calls (syscalls) to Windows ones.
- **WSL 2**: A full linux kernel running in a lightweight virtual machine, offering better performance, full system call compatibility, and full Docker support.

<Callout type="important">
  I highly recommend using **WSL 2** for most use cases due to its improved performance and compatibility and it is the default version when installing WSL.
</Callout>

## Installation & Setup

Before you begin, ensure that your **Windows 10 version is 2004 or higher** (Build 19041 or higher) or you're using **Windows 11**. Else, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) for manual installation steps.

<Steps>
### Enable WSL Feature

Basically, you can enable and install WSL with a single command. Open PowerShell in **Administrator mode** and run the following command:

```powershell
wsl --install
wsl --install -d <Distro> # To install a specific distribution
```

<Callout title="More information">
  This command does everything for you:
  - Enables the required **"Windows Subsystem for Linux"** optional feature.
  - Enables the **"Virtual Machine Platform"** optional feature.
  - Downloads and installs the **Ubuntu Linux distribution** by default.
  - **Sets WSL 2** as the default version for any new Linux distributions installed.
</Callout>

### Restart your computer when prompted [Optional]

In most cases, the above command will **not require a restart**. However, if the `wsl --install` command fails, you may need to manually enable the features and restart your computer.

Go to your Start Menu, search for **"Turn Windows features on or off"**, and enable the following features:
- Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Virtual Machine Platform

![windows-feature](/blog/mastering-wsl/windows-features.png)

After enabling these features, **restart your computer** to apply the changes.

### Initial Setup of your Linux Distro

After you done all the steps correctly, you will see a new **"Ubuntu"** application in your **Start Menu**. Launch it and a terminal window will open. It will take a few minutes to set itself up.

<Callout title="About the username">
  - The username can be anything you like
  - It is recommended to use a lowercase name without spaces or special characters
  - It will be your default user for the Linux environment
  - It will be the administrator for the Linux environment (sudo user)
</Callout>

After that, you will be prompted to enter a new **UNIX username** and **password**. Basically, this user account is your default user for the Linux environment and is separate from your Windows user account.

Also, make sure to **remember the password you set here**, as you will need it for executing commands with `sudo` privileges. Once you have completed these steps, you will be **logged into your new Ubuntu terminal**.

Install the latest PowerShell for new features and improvements! https://aka.ms/PSWindows

PS C:\Users\karchunt> wsl --install
Downloading: Ubuntu
Installing: Ubuntu
Distribution successfully installed. It can be launched via 'wsl.exe -d Ubuntu'
Launching Ubuntu...
Provisioning the new WSL instance Ubuntu
This might take a while...
Create a default Unix user account: karchunt
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

```
</Steps>

## Basic WSL Management Commands

Let's go through some basic WSL management commands that you might find useful.

### List available Linux distributions

This command wil list all the Linux distributions that are available for installation via WSL through the online store.

```powershell
wsl -l -o
wsl --list --online
```

```powershell filename="terminal"
PS C:\Users\karchunt\Desktop\All\karchunt.com> wsl -l -o
The following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.
Install using 'wsl.exe --install <Distro>'.

```

### List installed Linux distributions

This command will list all your installed distros and their current status.

```powershell
wsl -l -v
wsl --list --verbose
```

```powershell filename="terminal"
PS C:\Users\karchunt\Desktop\All\karchunt.com> wsl -l -v
  NAME              STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu-24.04      Stopped         2
  Ubuntu            Stopped         2
  docker-desktop    Stopped         2
```

### Set a Specific Distro to use WSL 1 or WSL 2

This command allows you to change the WSL version for a specific installed distribution.

```powershell
wsl --set-version <distribution-name> <wsl-version>
wsl --set-version Ubuntu-24.04 2
```

### Set WSL 2 as the Default Version

This command allows you to set the default WSL version for any new Linux distributions that you install in the future.

```powershell
wsl --set-default-version <version>
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

### Set default Linux distribution

This command allows you to set the default Linux distribution that will be used when you run `wsl` without any arguments.

```powershell
wsl --set-default <distribution-name>
wsl --set-default Ubuntu-24.04
```

### Terminate a running Distro

This command allows you to terminate a specific running WSL distribution.

```powershell
wsl --terminate <distribution-name>
```

### Shutdown WSL (All Distros)

This command allows you to shut down all running WSL distributions. This is useful if you want to free up system resources or if you need to restart WSL for any reason.

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

## Core WSL Usage & File System

### Accessing Windows Files from WSL

WSL **automatically mounts your Windows drives** under the `/mnt` directory. For example, your `C:` drive is **accessible** at `/mnt/c`.

You can try to `cd` into your Windows user directory using wsl terminal:

```powershell
karchunt@DESKTOP-CCAQ09F:/mnt/c/Users/karchunt$
```

or using WSL command line

```powershell
wsl cd /mnt/c/Users/karchunt
wsl ls -la
wsl pwd
```

### Running a Windows Executable from WSL

You can run Windows executables directly from your WSL terminal. For example, to open Notepad, you can simply type:

```bash
notepad.exe <file>
# or
explorer.exe <path>
```

## WSL Configuration (.wslconfig)

<Callout title="References">
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#wslconfig
</Callout>

You can **configure global WSL settings** using a `.wslconfig` file located in your Windows user profile directory (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.wslconfig`).

Here is an example of a `.wslconfig` file:

```ini filename=".wslconfig"
[wsl2]
memory=4GB   # Limits VM memory to 4 GB
processors=2 # Limits VM to 2 processors
swap=2GB     # Sets swap file size to 2 GB
swapFile=C:\\temp\\wsl_swap.vhdx # Custom swap file location
localhostForwarding=true # Enables localhost forwarding
```

After creating or modifying the `.wslconfig` file, you need to **shut down WSL** for the changes to take effect:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```
