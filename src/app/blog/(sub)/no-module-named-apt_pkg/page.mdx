## No module named APT-PKG

The error **"No module named APT-PKG"** typically occurs when the **Python APT package is not installed** or is **improperly configured**. This package is essential for interacting with the Advanced Package Tool (APT) system in Debian-based Linux distributions.

### Method 1 - Install `python-apt` package

This is the most straightforward way to resolve the issue, as the `apt_pkg` module is part of the `python-apt` package.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-apt  # or python3-apt for Python 3
```

### Method 2 - Reinstall `python3-apt` package

This method basically reinstalls the package to ensure all files are correctly placed.

```bash
sudo apt-get python3-apt --reinstall
```

### Method 3 - Properly set `.so` file location

This method involves copying the shared object file to the correct location.

```bash
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
sudo cp apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so
```
