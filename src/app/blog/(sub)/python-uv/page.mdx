## What is Python UV?

UV is a **fast**, modern Python package manager written in **Rust**. It's designed as a drop-in replacement for `pip`, `pip-tools`, and other package managers, offering **significantly better performance** (10-100x faster than `pip`) while **maintaining compatibility** with the Python ecosystem.

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install Python UV. I will demonstrate only the most common methods here. For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Standalone installer

<Tabs items={['Linux/macOS', 'Windows']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### PyPI

Just to let you know that, `uv` is also available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/).

```bash
pip install uv
```

## Shell autocompletion

After installing UV, I highly recommend setting up shell autocompletion for a better user experience.

<Tabs items={['Bash', 'PowerShell']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  echo 'eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  ```powershell
  if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
    New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
  }
  Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& uv generate-shell-completion powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



## Guides

### Install Python

UV will **detect and use the system Python** by default. However, you can also install and also manage multiple Python versions using UV.

```bash
# Install the latest Python version
uv python install

# Install a specific Python version
uv python install <version>
uv python install 3.14 

# Reinstall all previously installed Python versions, useful when there are updates available
uv python install --reinstall

# View installed Python versions
uv python list 

# Upgrade all installed Python versions
uv python upgrade

# Upgrade a Python version
uv python upgrade <version>
uv python upgrade 3.13
```

After installation, `uv` will auto add the installed Python version to your PATH. So in your terminal, you can directly run the `python` or `pythonX.Y` command.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\karchunt> python3.13
Python 3.13.7 (tags/v3.13.7:bcee1c3, Aug 14 2025, 14:15:11) [MSC v.1944 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```


### Update UV

To update UV to the latest version, you can use the following command:

```bash
uv self update
# or
pip install --upgrade uv
```
