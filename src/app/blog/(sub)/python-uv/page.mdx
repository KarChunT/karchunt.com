## What is Python UV?

UV is a **fast**, modern Python package manager written in **Rust**. It's designed as a drop-in replacement for `pip`, `pip-tools`, and other package managers, offering **significantly better performance** (10-100x faster than `pip`) while **maintaining compatibility** with the Python ecosystem.

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install Python UV. I will demonstrate only the most common methods here. For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Standalone installer

<Tabs items={['Linux/macOS', 'Windows']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### PyPI

Just to let you know that, `uv` is also available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/).

```bash
pip install uv
```

## Shell autocompletion

After installing UV, I highly recommend setting up shell autocompletion for a better user experience.

<Tabs items={['Bash', 'PowerShell']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  echo 'eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  ```powershell
  if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
    New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
  }
  Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& uv generate-shell-completion powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## UV Tool Management and Verification

Once the binary is installed, the version can be verified by running:

```bash
uv --version
```

To update UV to the latest version, you can use the following command:

```bash
uv self update
# or
pip install --upgrade uv
```

## Starting Fresh: The Modern UV Project Workflow

This workflow uses `UV` to create and manage a new Python project from scratch.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Create a new project directory

```bash
mkdir my_uv_project
cd my_uv_project
```

### Step 2: Initialize a new UV project

The `uv init` command sets up a new UV project by creating **standard metadata files** such as `pyproject.toml` and `.python-version` (which specifies the required Python interpreter version for the project).

```bash
uv init
```

The folder structure will look like this:

<FileTree>
  <Folder name="my_uv_project" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name=".python-version" />
    <FileTree.File name="pyproject.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="main.py" />
    <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
  </Folder>
</FileTree>

### Step 3 (Optional): Environment creation

The `uv venv` command creates an isolated virtual environment, typically named `.venv`, within the project directory.

```bash
uv venv
```

If a specific Python version is required, it can be specified using the `--python` flag. A significant benefit of `uv` is its ability to **automatically download and manage** the specified Python version if it's not already installed on the system.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

### Step 4: Install dependencies, lock, and sync

To install dependencies, use the `uv add` command followed by the package names. It will **update the project's dependency list** in `pyproject.toml`, **resolves the dependency graph**, and **installs the packages** into the virtual environment. For example, to install `requests` and `ruff`, run:

```bash
uv add requests ruff
```

`uv add` will also create or update the `uv.lock` file, which **contains the exact versions** of all installed packages and their dependencies.

The `uv lock` command will **resolve the full project dependency tree/graph** to produce the `uv.lock` file.

The `uv sync` command will **synchronize the virtual environment** with the dependencies specified in the `uv.lock` file. This ensures that the environment is consistent and reproducible.

```bash
uv lock
uv sync
```

### Step 5: Running Scripts or Tools

You can run Python scripts directly using the `uv run` command. This ensures that the script is executed within the context of the project's virtual environment, using the correct Python interpreter and installed dependencies.

```bash
uv run python main.py
uv run main.py
```

You can also run **installed tools or packages** directly using `uv run`. For example, to run `ruff` for linting your code:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

### Step 6: Compilation and Export

To compile your project's dependencies into a `requirements.txt` file, you can use the `uv export` command. This is particularly useful for sharing your project's dependencies with others or for deployment purposes.

```bash
uv export -o requirements.txt
```

There is the another useful method to export dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using the `uv pip compile` command. This is useful for deployment targets that do not yet support `uv.lock` natively.

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
```
</Steps>

## Command Equivalency

For developers transitioning from `pip` and `venv` structure to `uv`, here are some equivalent commands to help you get started:

### Environment Inspection and Management Mapping

| Pip | UV |
| --- | -- |
| `python -m venv .venv` | `uv venv` |
| `pip install <package`> | `uv add <package>` |
| `pip install -r requirements.txt` | `uv add -r requirements.txt` |
| `pip freeze > requirements.txt` | `uv export -o requirements.txt` |
| `pip list` | `uv tree` |
| `pip uninstall <package>` | `uv remove <package>` |

### Direct Installation with `uv pip install`

`uv` also contains a direct traditional `pip install` command for users who prefer that method.

```bash
uv pip install <package>
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Useful guide

### Install Python

`UV` will **detect and use the system Python** by default.  
However, you can also install and manage multiple Python versions using UV.

```bash
# Install the latest Python version
uv python install

# Install a specific Python version
uv python install <version>
uv python install 3.14 

# Reinstall all previously installed Python versions, useful when there are updates available
uv python install --reinstall

# View installed Python versions
uv python list 

# Upgrade all installed Python versions
uv python upgrade

# Upgrade a Python version
uv python upgrade <version>
uv python upgrade 3.13
```

After installation, `uv` will auto add the installed Python version to your **PATH**. So in your terminal, you can directly run the `python` or `pythonX.Y` command.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\karchunt> python3.13
