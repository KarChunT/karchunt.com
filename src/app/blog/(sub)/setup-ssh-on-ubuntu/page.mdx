## Setup SSH on Ubuntu

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a protocol that allows **secure remote access** to a computer over an unsecured network. Today, I will guide you through the **best practices** for setting up SSH on an Ubuntu system.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Install OpenSSH Server

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y openssh-server
```

### Step 2: Start and Enable SSH service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl status ssh # check if SSH is running
```

### Step 3: Configure SSH settings

To enhance security, you can modify the SSH configuration file by searching the following settings:
- `PasswordAuthentication no`: Disable password authentication to use key-based authentication.
- `PermitRootLogin no`: Disable root login via SSH.
- `AllowUsers your_username`: Restrict SSH access to specific users.
- `AllowGroups your_group`: Restrict SSH access to specific groups.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```bash filename="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
AllowUsers user1 user2 user3
AllowGroups sshusers
```

### Step 4: Restart SSH service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Step 5: Configure Firewall

Configuring firewall is very important to secure your server. By default, Ubuntu uses **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** and when you enable it, SSH connections are blocked. To allow SSH connections, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

```bash
kc@kcserver:~$ sudo ufw status
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere                  
22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

### Step 6: Reboot the server

The final step is to reboot the server to ensure all changes take effect.

```bash
sudo reboot
```
</Steps>
