## Ubuntu Theme Setup

<Callout>
  Customizing your Ubuntu can significantly **enhance your user experience**. In this guide, I will walk you through the steps to set up a beautiful and functional theme on your Ubuntu system.
</Callout>

Before we start, take a look at this website [gnome-look](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/) where you can find various themes, icons, and cursors for your Ubuntu desktop. I'm going to use one of my favorite themes called **[Orchis-theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Orchis-theme)**. Of course, you can choose any theme you like.

<Steps>
### Install gnome-tweaks

To fully customize your Ubuntu theme, you need to install `gnome-tweaks`.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gnome-tweaks gnome-shell-extensions
```

To open **gnome-tweaks**, there are two ways:
1. Open your terminal and type `gnome-tweaks`.
2. You can search for **"Tweaks"** in your application menu and launch it from there.

### Download and Install Orchis Theme

I'm going to `git clone` the Orchis theme repository and install it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinceliuice/Orchis-theme.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the cloned directory and run the installation script:

<Callout title="Note">
  There are a lot of options where you can configure the theme. Make sure you read the [README file](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Orchis-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation) section in the cloned repository.
</Callout>

```bash
cd Orchis-theme
./install.sh
./install.sh -h

# Here is the option that I selected
./install.sh -d $HOME/.themes -t all --tweaks black
```
- Make sure the theme is installed in the `~/.themes` directory.

### Change your theme in gnome-tweaks

After installing the theme, open **gnome-tweaks** and navigate to the **Appearance** section. Here, you can change your **Applications**, **Cursor**, and **Icons** themes.

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Orchis"
```

</Steps>

## Icons Setup

For the icons, I will use the **[candy-icons](https://github.com/EliverLara/candy-icons)**.

<Steps>

### Download zip file

```bash
wget https://github.com/EliverLara/candy-icons/archive/refs/heads/master.zip -O /tmp/candy.zip
```

### Unzip the file

Extract the .zip file to the icons directory either one of the following locations:
- `/usr/share/icons/` 
- `~/.local/share/.icons/`
- `~/.icons/`

```bash
unzip /tmp/candy.zip -d ~/.icons
```

### Change your icons in gnome-tweaks

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme "candy-icons"
```

## Gnome Extensions

Gnome extensions can significantly **enhance your desktop experience**. I will install a few useful extensions.

<Steps>
### Install Extension-manager

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager
```

### Open Extension-manager

```bash

```

### Install Extensions

You can search for the following extensions and install them:
- **Add to Desktop**: This extension allows you to add applications to your desktop easily.
- **GNOME Fuzzy App Search**: This extension enhances the search functionality in GNOME, making it more intuitive and faster.
- **App menu is back**: This extension brings back the application menu, providing quick access to application-specific options.
- **Clipboard Indicator**: This extension adds a clipboard indicator to the top bar, allowing you to manage your clipboard history easily.
- **Logo Menu**: This extension replaces the default GNOME logo with a customizable menu, giving you quick access to system settings and applications.
- **Text Clock**: This extension adds a text-based clock to the top bar, providing a clear and concise time display.
- **System Monitor**: This extension adds a system monitor to the top bar, allowing you to keep an eye on your system's performance and resource usage.
