## Get Python Project Libraries Using pipreqs

To get the libraries used in a Python project, you can use the `pipreqs` tool. This tool **scans your Python files** and **generates** a `requirements.txt` file with the libraries used in your project.

```bash
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs /path/to/your/project --force

# verify the generated requirements.txt
cat requirements.txt
```
