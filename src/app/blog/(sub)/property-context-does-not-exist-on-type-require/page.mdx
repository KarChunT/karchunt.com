## Property 'context' does not exist on type 'Require'

The error **Property 'context' does not exist on type 'Require'** typically occurs in TypeScript projects that use Webpack `require.context`. This happens because TypeScript by default **does not recognize** the `context` property on the `Require` type.

To resolve this issue, you need to **install the type definitions** for Webpack.

```bash
npm i -D @types/webpack-env
```
