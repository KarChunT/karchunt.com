## Steps to run a sudo command without a password

1. Open `/etc/sudoers` with `visudo` editor, as if straight away edit `/etc/sudoers` file with text editor, it won't validate the syntax.

   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

2. Append this line `username   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` at the end of the `/etc/sudoers` file

   ```bash filename="/etc/sudoers"
   # User privilege specification
   root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

   # Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
   %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

   # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
   %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

   # See sudoers(5) for more information on "@include" directives:

   @includedir /etc/sudoers.d
   kc      ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   ```

3. Open a new terminal window and test the command with **root** privileges
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
