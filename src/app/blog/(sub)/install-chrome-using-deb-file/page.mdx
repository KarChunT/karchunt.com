## Install Google Chrome using a .deb file

There are several ways to install Google Chrome on a Debian-based system, such as Ubuntu. One of the most straightforward methods is to download the .deb file directly from Google's official website and install it using the terminal. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

# when you faced Issues when install google, run the below command
sudo apt --fix-broken install or sudo apt-get install -f
```

After the installation is complete, you can launch Google Chrome from your applications menu or by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
# choose either one command to launch Google Chrome
google-chrome
google-chrome-stable
```
