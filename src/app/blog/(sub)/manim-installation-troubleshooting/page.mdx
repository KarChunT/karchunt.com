## Resolving pycairo Build Errors Due to Missing C Compiler on Ubuntu

Recently, I encountered an issue while installing Manim by running `uv add manim` in my terminal. The installation process failed with an error message indicating that `pycairo` could not be built **because a C compiler was not found**.

```bash
karchunt@kcserver:~/Desktop/docs$ uv add manim
Resolved 79 packages in 2.60s

  × Failed to build `pycairo==1.28.0`

      hint: This usually indicates a problem with the package or the build environment.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking and
        syncing.
```

The error means you're **missing a C compiler** (like) `gcc` or `clang` on your system, which is required to build certain Python packages like `pycairo` (a dependency of Manim).

To resolve this issue on Ubuntu, you can **install the necessary build tools** by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev
```

Then try installing Manim again:

```bash
uv add manim
```

This should resolve the `pycairo` build error and allow you to successfully install Manim.
