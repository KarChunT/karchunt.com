## Fix Docker permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`

The error message "permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock" typically occurs when the current user **does not have the necessary permissions** to access the Docker daemon.

To resolve this issue, you can **add your user** to the `docker` group, which grants the necessary permissions to interact with the Docker daemon without requiring `sudo` for every command.

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

docker ps # test connection
```
