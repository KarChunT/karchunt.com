## Sphinx Documentation

In this tutorial, we will explore how to create and manage documentation using **Sphinx**, a powerful documentation generator for projets.

<Callout title="What is Sphinx?">
  Sphinx is a documentation generator for Python projects, and it is widely used for creating intelligent and beautiful documentation. It converts `reStructuredText` files into various output formats, including **HTML** and **PDF**. Sphinx is highly extensible and supports various plugins and themes, making it a popular choice for both small and large projects.
</Callout>

## Getting Started with Sphinx

<Steps>
### Install Sphinx

<Callout title="Installation Methods">
  https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html
</Callout>

To get started, you need to install Sphinx, which can be done using different methods. I'm going to use `uv` to install Sphinx for this tutorial, but you can also use `pip` or `conda`.

```bash
uv init --bare
uv add sphinx

# Verify the installation
uv run sphinx-build --version
```

### Create a New Sphinx Project

To create a new Sphinx project, you can use the `sphinx-quickstart` command. This command will guide you through the setup process like setting up a source directory and creates a default configuration file `conf.py`.

```bash
uv run sphinx-quickstart
```

Here is the sample output of the command:

```powershell
(sphinx-tutorial) PS C:\Users\karchunt\Desktop\All\sphinx-tutorial\new> uv run sphinx-quickstart
Welcome to the Sphinx 8.2.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Selected root path: .

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: n

The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: sphinx-tutorial
> Author name(s): karchunt
> Project release []: 

If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
translate text that it generates into that language.

For a list of supported codes, see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.
> Project language [en]: 

Creating file C:\Users\karchunt\Desktop\All\sphinx-tutorial\new\conf.py.
Creating file C:\Users\karchunt\Desktop\All\sphinx-tutorial\new\index.rst.
Creating file C:\Users\karchunt\Desktop\All\sphinx-tutorial\new\Makefile.
Creating file C:\Users\karchunt\Desktop\All\sphinx-tutorial\new\make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file C:\Users\karchunt\Desktop\All\sphinx-tutorial\new\index.rst and create other documentation  
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
```

### Build a live documentation

Once you have created your Sphinx project, I always recommend using `sphinx-autobuild` to build a live documentation. It will automatically rebuild the documentation and refresh the browser whenever you make changes to the source files.

```bash
uv add sphinx-autobuild
uv run sphinx-autobuild <source-dir> <output-dir>
uv run sphinx-autobuild ./ output
```

Here is the sample output of the command:

```powershell
(sphinx-tutorial) PS C:\Users\karchunt\Desktop\All\sphinx-tutorial\new> uv run sphinx-autobuild ./ output
[sphinx-autobuild] Starting initial build
[sphinx-autobuild] > python -m sphinx build ./ output

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You should see the default Sphinx documentation page.

### Document your project

Now you can start documenting your project by editing the `index.rst` file and adding more `.rst` files as needed. I will only cover some basic content here.

<Tabs items={['index.rst', 'docs/usage.rst', 'docs/code.rst']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```rst filename="index.rst"
    Welcome to KarChunT's documentation!
    ====================================

    This is just a demo documnetation by using **Sphinx**. Here is the `Reference <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ to Sphinx official website.

    .. note::

      This project is under testing, so the content is very limited.

      Check out the :doc:`docs/usage` section for further information, including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the project.
      
      For API documentation and code examples, see the :doc:`docs/code` section.

    Contents
    --------

    .. toctree::
      docs/usage
      docs/code
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```rst filename="docs/usage.rst"
    Usage
    =====

    .. _installation:

    Installation
    ------------

    To use Lumache, first install it using pip:

    .. code-block:: console

      (.venv) $ pip install lumache
    ```
  
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```rst filename="docs/code.rst"
    Code
    ====

    To document the Python objects, you can use the ``py:function`` directive to document a Python function

    .. py:function:: add_numbers(a, b)

        Adds two numbers and returns the result.
        
        :param a: The first number.
        :param b: The second number.
        :type a: int or float
        :type b: int or float
        :return: The sum of the two numbers.
        :rtype: int or float
        :raises TypeError: If either a or b is not a number.

    To cross-reference the function in other parts of your documentation, you can use the ``:py:func:`` role:

    You can use the :py:func:`add_numbers` function to add two numbers together.
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

Here are some screenshots of the generated documentation:

  </Tabs.Tab>

    ![code](/blog/sphinx-doc-generator/code.png)
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### [Optional] Customize the theme

Sphinx comes with **several built-in themes**, and you can also **install third-party themes** to customize the look and feel of your documentation. In this tutorial, I'm going to use the **popular theme** called [readthedocs](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

To use the `readthedocs` theme, first you need to install it.

```bash
uv add sphinx_rtd_theme
```

After installing the theme, you need to update the `conf.py` file to use the `readthedocs` theme.

```python filename="conf.py"
extensions = [
    ...
    'sphinx_rtd_theme',
]

html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"
```

Here is the sample screenshot of the `readthedocs` theme:

![readthedocs](/blog/sphinx-doc-generator/readthedocs.png)

### Build the documentation

Once you have added your content and customized the theme, you can build the documentation in multiple ways.

<Callout title="References">
  - [Builders list](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/builders/index.html#builders)
  - [sphinx-build man page](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html)
</Callout>

```bash
uv run sphinx-build -M <buildername> <source-dir> <output-dir>

# example
uv run sphinx-build -M html ./ output

# or you can use the Makefile (Linux/Mac)
make <buildername>

# or you can use the Makefile (Windows)
./make.bat <buildername>
```

After building the documentation, you can choose to host it on various platforms, such as **GitHub Pages**, **Read the Docs**, or your own web server. Here is the official guide on [how to publish your sphinx docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/deploying.html).
