## Install Docker Engine on WSL

Before installing Docker Engine on WSL, make sure you have WSL installed and running. If not, you can install it by following the instructions in the [Mastering WSL](/blog/mastering-wsl) post.

<Steps>
### Setup Docker's `apt` repository

The main reason we need to setup Docker's `apt` repository is to ensure that we're **installing the latest version of Docker Engine** on WSL. By default, the `apt` repository only contains the stable version of Docker Engine, which may not be the latest version. 

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.sources <<EOF
Types: deb
URIs: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu
Suites: $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}")
Components: stable
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
EOF

sudo apt update
```

### Install the Docker packages

```bash
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

By default, the Docker service will start automatically after installation. You can verify it by using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If it is disabled, you cam enable it by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Verify the installation

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

### Add your user to the docker group [Recommended]

By default, you need `sudo` access to run Docker commands. To avoid this, you can add the current user to the `docker` group.

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

# check the access
docker run hello-world
```
</Steps>
