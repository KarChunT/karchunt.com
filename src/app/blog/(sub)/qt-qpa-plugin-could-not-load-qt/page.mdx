## `qt.qpa.plugin` could not load qt

Here is an error message that you might encounter when using **OpenCV with Qt on Linux**:

```text
qt.qpa.plugin: From 6.5.0, xcb-cursor0 or libxcb-cursor0 is needed to load the Qt xcb platform plugin.
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "/home/kc/Desktop/projects/pretty/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/cv2/qt/plugins" even though it was found.
```

This appplication failed to start because **no Qt platform plugin could be initialized**. Also, the error indicates that the Qt platform plugin `xcb` is **missing or not properly configured**. This is often required by libraries like OpenCV when using GUI features. Here's how to resolve the issue:

```bash
# Install the necessary libraries for the `xcb` plugin
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libxcb-cursor0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-render-util0
```
