## Convert Sphinx Documentation to PDF

In this tutorial, we will explore how to **convert Sphinx documentation into PDF format**. The conversion of Sphinx documentation to PDF can be achieved through **various methods**, including using **LaTeX or other tools**.
- Using default Sphinx's built-in LaTeX builder
- Using `sphinx-simplepdf` extension (Recommended)

Again, there are other method available, such as `rst2pdf`, `pandoc`, `sphinx-pdf-generate`, or etc, but I won't cover them here.

### Using default Sphinx's built-in LaTeX builder

This method is the **default way** to convert Sphinx documentation to PDF. It **first generates LaTeX files** from the **Sphinx source files** and then **compiles them into a PDF using a LaTeX distribution/engine** like **TeX Live** or **MiKTeX**.

Before you start, **ensure you have a LaTeX distribution** installed on your system. You can use TeX Live (cross-platform) or MiKTeX (Windows). Else, you may **encounter errors** during the PDF generation process.

```text
'latexmk' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```

Here is the command to generate the PDF:

```bash
make latexpdf
```

This command will **generate LaTeX source files** in the `_build/latex` directory and then attempt to compile them into a PDF.

To be honest, I had encountered some **issues with Unicode characters** when I tried to generate the PDF. If you encounter similar issues, you may need to set the `latex_engine` in your `conf.py` file to `xelatex` or `lualatex`. **But trust me, this method is a bit troublesome**.

```python filename="conf.py"
latex_engine = "xelatex" # or "lualatex"
```

### Using `sphinx-simplepdf` extension (Recommended)

</Callout>

This method is **more straightforward** and **user-friendly**. The `sphinx-simplepdf` extension **simplifies the process of generating PDFs** from Sphinx documentation. I highly recommend this method for its ease of use and better handling of various content types.

```bash
pip install sphinx-simplepdf
```

After you install the `sphinx-simplepdf` package, make sure to install `WeasyPrint` as well, since it is a **dependency** of `sphinx-simplepdf`. Refer to the [WeasyPrint installation guide](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html) for detailed instructions.

Then add `sphinx_simplepdf` to your extensions list in `conf.py` and run `make simplepdf`.

```python filename="conf.py"
extensions = [
    ...
    'sphinx_simplepdf',
]
```

```bash
make simplepdf
```
