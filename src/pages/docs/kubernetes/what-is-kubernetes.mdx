Kubernetes enables you to **deploy multiple instances** of your application as required and **allows easy communication** between **different services** within your application by **hosting** your applications as **containers** in an automated manner.

## kubectl

Reference
- [Installation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)

**kubectl** is a command line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters, using the Kubernetes API. It allows you to run commands (deploy or manage applications) against Kubernetes clusters. It looks for a file in `$HOME/.kube` for configuration.

```bash
kubectl cluster-info # get cluster information
kubectl get nodes # get nodes information in the cluster
```
