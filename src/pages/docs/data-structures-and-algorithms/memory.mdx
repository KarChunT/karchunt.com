# Memory (RAM)

## What is RAM?

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  <div>1 byte = 8 bits</div>
  <div>A bit is a 0 or 1</div>
</Callout>

**RAM** stands for **Random Access Memory**, which we call as **Memory** or **RAM**.
- It is basically **store all variables**.
- It is measured in **bytes**.
- It has two **components**;
  - value
  - address

### Storing Array of Integers in RAM

In this case, we have an array of integers. For example, we have `[1, 2, 3]`. But how can we store all these integers in the RAM, as computers only **understand bits 0 or 1**.

So the integer will be **_converted_ into bits** like for example, 1 can be represented as `00000001`, 2 as `00000010`, and 3 as `00000011`. Then we can only put that into RAM.

RAM can be consider as **contiguous block of data** (memory is allocated to a process or file needing it), which means that it has two components which are **value and address**. Each element in array will be **stored continously in order**. Do take note that, we **cannot determine and choose what location** the data will be stored into the RAM.

You might have a question, why the address is **incrementing by 4** every time?
- You need to know that Integers are **occupying 4 bytes (32 bits) in memory**. So every integer that stored in the RAM will take 4 bytes to store.
- Each **integer** takes **32 bits of space**, **4 bytes**, hence the **addresses** are **4 bytes apart**

### Storing Array of Characters in RAM

Storing characters is also pretty the same as integers, just the address is different, as **each character only takes 1 byte to store in memory**.

Each **character** takes **8 bits of space**, **1 byte**, hence the **addresses** are **1 byte apart**.
