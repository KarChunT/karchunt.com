# Dynamic Array

## What is Dynamic Array?

Dynamic Array will **auto grows/resized** when we make an **insertion (arrays grow)** and there is **no more space left**. **No need** to **specify** the **array size** when initialization. Usually, we will **double in array size** based on the default size, and different languages may have **default size**.

![dynamic array 1](/docs/data-structures-and-algorithms/dynamic-array-1.png)

When we **append, delete, pop, etc** to the array, we have a **pointer** that tells us that the **last index element** of this array. Therefore when we **pop** the value, we know the **time operation** of **pop is O(1)** because we have that pointer to the last element when they add new element into it.

![dynamic array 2](/docs/data-structures-and-algorithms/dynamic-array-2.png)

When we **resized the array**, we will create a **new brand array** and this new brand array will have **new space allocated** for it in **memory**. Then, all the array elements will be **copied** from the **old array to new array**, and the old array will be **deallocated** (free this from memory).
- Double the capacity called **Amortized time complexity**. Amortized time complexity **averages the running times of operations in a sequence over that sequence (average time taken per operation, if you do many operations)**. That means, we resize the array operation is **O(n)** and for adding elements part is **O(1)**, since this operation is not performed every time we add an element, so the average time taken per operation is **O(1)**.
- Therefore, we can see that operation time for overall is O(1), just only resize part operation is O(n), so it is **much lower than worst-case**.

| Operation | Big-O Time | Notes |
| --------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Access | O(1) | - |
| Insert/Remove End | O(1) | - |
| Insert/Remove Middle | O(n) | You have to shift the values |

    ```python
    class DynamicArray:
        def __init__(self, capacity: int):
            self.capacity = capacity
            self.length = 0
            self.array = [0] * capacity

        def get(self, i: int) -> int:
            return self.array[i]

        def set(self, i: int, n: int) -> None:
            self.array[i] = n

        def pushback(self, n: int) -> None:
            if self.length == self.capacity:
                self.resize()
            self.array[self.length] = n
            self.length += 1

        def popback(self) -> int:
            if self.length > 0:
                self.length -= 1
            return self.array[self.length]
    
        def resize(self) -> None:
            self.capacity = self.capacity * 2
            new_array = [0] * self.capacity

            for i in range(self.length):
                new_array[i] = self.array[i]
            self.array = new_array

        def getSize(self) -> int:
            return self.length

        def getCapacity(self) -> int:
            return self.capacity
