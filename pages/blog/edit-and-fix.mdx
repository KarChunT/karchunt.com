# Edit & Fix

## Edit hostname on Ubuntu

1. Edit `/etc/hostname`

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hostname
   ```

2. Replace any hostname you like. Save the file.

   ```bash filename="/etc/hostname"
   hello-laptop
   ```

3. Reboot the system

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. Check your hostname
   ```bash
   hostname
   ```

## Fix docker-compose ERROR: max > virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to > at least [262144]

Increase VM max map count to the respective value

```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

## Fix Git LFS Pointers issue

```bash
git lfs migrate import --no-rewrite "file_path" "file_path"
git lfs ls-files | grep "file_path"
git lfs push origin --all
git push origin --all
```

Basically, the first comand is to reimport back those files into pointer files in LFS, without writing the history. Do take note that you can include as many `file_path` as you can.

Next, the second command is to help us to check whether the `file_path` already been imported as Git LFS pointers files.

Lastly, we just need to push back the LFS files and the contents to the repository itself.

## No Module named 'apt_pkg'

### Method 1 - Install `python-apt` package

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-apt
```

### Method 2 - Reinstall `python3-apt` package

```bash
sudo apt-get python3-apt --reinstall
```

### Method 3 - Properly set `.so` file location

```bash
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
sudo cp apt_pkg.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so
```
