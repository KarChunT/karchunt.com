3. Choose **Runner Image and Architecture**. Do take note that, the architecture is based on your device specifications. For my case is **x64**.

4. Download the **necessary files**. You can find all these commands on the same page where you select Runner Image and Architecture.

   <details>
   <summary>
      <b>Windows Runner</b>
   </summary>
   ```ps
   # Create a folder under the drive root
   mkdir actions-runner; cd actions-runner

   # Download the latest runner installer file

   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-win-x64-2.311.0.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.311.0.zip

   # Extract the installer

   Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ; [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD/actions-runner-win-x64-2.311.0.zip", "$PWD")

   ````
   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>
      <b>Linux Runner</b>
   </summary>

   ```bash
   # Create a folderr under drive root
   mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner

   # Download the latest runner installer file
   curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz

   # Extract the installer
   tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz
   ````

   </details>

   Here is the output after executing all these commands.

5. Configure and start the runner.

   <details>
   <summary>
      <b>Windows Runner</b>
   </summary>

   ```ps
   # Configure the runner
   ./config.cmd --url <github-repo-url> --token <token> --labels <lists-of-label>

   # Start the runner
   ./run.cmd
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>
      <b>Linux Runner</b>
   </summary>

   ```bash
   # Configure the runner
   ./config.sh --url <github-repo-url> --token <token> --labels <lists-of-label>

   # Start the runner
   ./run.sh
   ```

   </details>

   Programmatically assign [labels](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/using-labels-with-self-hosted-runners) to a self-hosted runner is optional.
   Here is the sample configuration of the runner.

   Verify your runner being setup.

6. Using your self-hosted runner. Create a new file under `.github/workflows/test.yaml`.

   ```yaml {6} caption="test.yaml"
   name: Test runner
   on:
      push:
   jobs:
      build:
         runs-on: ["self-hosted"]
         steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - name: list directory
            run: ls
   ```

   Here is the output after all the CI jobs are completed.

7. Optional: You can configure the [self-hosted runner application as a service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service)
