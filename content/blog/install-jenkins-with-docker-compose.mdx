</Callout>

1. Create `docker-compose.yml`

   ```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     jenkins:
       image: jenkins/jenkins:jdk11
       restart: always
       privileged: true
       user: root
       ports:
         - '8081:8080'
         - '50000:5000'
       container_name: jenkins_jdk11
       volumes:
         - ~/Desktop/self-hosted/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
         - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
   ```

   - You can map `/var/jenkins_home` to any local location you liked

2. Start `docker-compose.yml` as background

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Verify Jenkins container service

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. Get the Jenkins admin password

   ```bash
   docker exec jenkins_jdk11 cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```

5. Open your browser, navigate to `localhost:8081`, and paste your password
